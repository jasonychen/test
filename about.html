        <p>
          Hi! My name is Jason Chen and I am a 4th year Informatics Major at the University of California, Irvine. I come from a small town named Diamond Bar, and am currently living in Irvine as I work and go to school here. I currently am working at a company called Schneider Electric Software, where I do QA work and web development. Prior to my internship with Schneider, I have also interned at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and at the Academia Sinica in Taiwan. 
        </p>

      <h3>My skills</h3>
       <p>
        I am skilled in the following languages: Python, C++, Assembly Language, Java, Javascript, HTML, and Powerscript. I am also very flexible in terms of working in different environments and with different team members. 
      </p>
      <p> I have also been in an officer position for my entire college career, and know how to manage projects, meet deadlines, and work with limited resources in order to get the best events.
      </p>

     <h3>My interests</h3>
       <p>
        In my free time I like to play games! I currently play League of Legends and Super Smash Brothers Melee and I think I'm pretty decent at both of them! I also listen to music; I enjoy all music but I think my favorite genre currently is Hip Hop. I am also interested in using my money on overpriced food and drinks. If you saw my picture on the home page, you most likely saw that my favorite drink is boba!

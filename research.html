         <li>
          <h3><a href ="./img/userinterview.jpg">User Interviews</a></h3>
          <p>The user interviews were very helpful because I was able to directly connect with people who would be reading my site and gather their input on their toughts, ways to improve, etc. The hardest part was making sure that my questions were the right ones. Some questions that I had asked were "What are some instant red flags for a website?" and "What kind of websites do you go to regularly and why?".</p>
     
         </li>
         <li>
           <h3><a href ="./img/competitor.jpg">Competitor Analysis</a></h3>
         <p>The competitor analysis was instrumental in creating my site because it gave me an idea of what to do. I reviewed some portfolios and liked all the majority that I had found and kept track of them in the analysis. When looking at them I looked at what features I should also try and implement, as well as what I did not like to make sure I avoided repeating that on my own site. </p>
    
         </li>
         <li>
           <h3><a href ="./img/matrix.jpg">Feature Value Matrix</a></h3>
           <p>Doing the feature value matrix allowed me to create a list of features that I planned on putting into my portfolio and prioritizing implementation. It was helpful because it let me plan my site and the general amount of work I needed to do first by looking at the features with highest user/business value and lowest development effort.</p>
  
         </li>
        <li>
           <h3><a href ="./img/prior.jpg">Feature Prioritization</a></h3>
           <p>Feature prioritization was helpful by solidfying in me the most important features that was decided with the feature value matrix. Though the matrix was good, having it visualized with the various models like the Kano model helped to visualize which features should be implemented first.</p>
   
         </li>
       </ul>

       <h1 class="page-title">Testing - click the titles to get a screenshot!</h1>
       <ul id="sc">
         <li>
          <h3><a href ="./img/userstories.jpg">User Stories</a></h3>
          <p>The user stories were helpful because they let me think about various users would use features of my website and how each different user would have a different intent for using the same feature. During the creation of my  stories, I had to think about the most likely people that would look at my site(such as hiring managers or even just friends). Afterwards I wanted to see if the features were giving out the intended output that I created them for.</p>
     
         </li>
         <li>
           <h3><a href ="./img/walkthrough.jpg">Cognitive Walkthrough</a></h3>
         <p>The cognitive walkthrough helped to show some real usage of my site, and how features were often used and not used. I also realized that there were some features of my site that were obvious to me as I had worked on them, or that one could infer from working on a portfolios ite, but from a user who had not gone on a portfolio site before, they missed some information. It allowed me to see what changes I needed to make and how to make my site more friendly to all types of users. </p>
    
         </li>
         <li>
           <h3><a href ="./img/testing.jpg">User Testing</a></h3>
           <p>The user testing was interesting, as I created both click and questions tests for users to answer using a site called Usability Hub. I liked the click tests because although they were simple, people gave some interesting insight as to why they clicked(though there were still some responses that were not so helpful). The questions tests were better as some people seemed to be more in-depth, and even if I got a few silly answers, it is worth it to conduct the user testing if I get a constructive answer out of at least one of the tests and find a way to improve my portfolio.</p>

          <h3><a href ="./img/userinterview.jpg">User Interviews</a></h3>
          <p>The user interviews were very helpful because I was able to directly connect with people who would be reading my site and gather their input on their toughts, ways to improve, etc. The hardest part was making sure that my questions were the right ones. Some questions that I had asked were "What are some instant red flags for a website?" and "What kind of websites do you go to regularly and why?".</p>
     
         </li>
         <li>
           <h3><a href ="./img/competitor.jpg">Competitor Analysis</a></h3>
         <p>The competitor analysis was instrumental in creating my site because it gave me an idea of what to do. I reviewed some portfolios and liked all the majority that I had found and kept track of them in the analysis. When looking at them I looked at what features I should also try and implement, as well as what I did not like to make sure I avoided repeating that on my own site. </p>
    
         </li>
         <li>
           <h3><a href ="./img/matrix.jpg">Feature Value Matrix</a></h3>
           <p>Doing the feature value matrix allowed me to create a list of features that I planned on putting into my portfolio and prioritizing implementation. It was helpful because it let me plan my site and the general amount of work I needed to do first by looking at the features with highest user/business value and lowest development effort.</p>
  
         </li>
        <li>
           <h3><a href ="./img/prior.jpg">Feature Prioritization</a></h3>
           <p>Feature prioritization was helpful by solidfying in me the most important features that was decided with the feature value matrix. Though the matrix was good, having it visualized with the various models like the Kano model helped to visualize which features should be implemented first.</p>

          <h3><a href ="./img/userstories.jpg">User Stories</a></h3>
          <p>The user stories were helpful because they let me think about various users would use features of my website and how each different user would have a different intent for using the same feature. During the creation of my  stories, I had to think about the most likely people that would look at my site(such as hiring managers or even just friends). Afterwards I wanted to see if the features were giving out the intended output that I created them for.</p>

         <li>
           <h3><a href ="./img/walkthrough.jpg">Cognitive Walkthrough</a></h3>
         <p>The cognitive walkthrough helped to show some real usage of my site, and how features were often used and not used. I also realized that there were some features of my site that were obvious to me as I had worked on them, or that one could infer from working on a portfolios ite, but from a user who had not gone on a portfolio site before, they missed some information. It allowed me to see what changes I needed to make and how to make my site more friendly to all types of users. </p>
    
         </li>
         <li>
           <h3><a href ="./img/testing.jpg">User Testing</a></h3>
           <p>The user testing was interesting, as I created both click and questions tests for users to answer using a site called Usability Hub. I liked the click tests because although they were simple, people gave some interesting insight as to why they clicked(though there were still some responses that were not so helpful). The questions tests were better as some people seemed to be more in-depth, and even if I got a few silly answers, it is worth it to conduct the user testing if I get a constructive answer out of at least one of the tests and find a way to improve my portfolio.</p>

         <h1 class="page-title">Summary of Findings</h1>
        <p>
          The User research and testing have been pivotal to helping me throughout the creation of this project. The user interviews were helpful by giving me what different users would expect from a portfolio site, and acted as a sort of "requirements" gathering session for my site. After getting these, I had to decide which features would be the most important to prioritize with the feature value matrix/prioritization. I noticed that the majority of users had just given features that were widely used among all websites and were not specific to portfolio sites. Without doing the user research, I would have been caught up in some more specific features or would have even put too much features that I saw other portfolio sites in the competitive analysis, and not deliver any of the content. Thus the user research was very important because it allowed me to get a realistic idea of what a portfolio site should be and how to create a general idea of what I wanted for my own.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the user testing, I did find that the cognitive walkthroughs were more helpful than the user stories and testing specifically just because I get to hear more in-depth feedback from real users. User stories allowed me to think about how I think different users would use my portfolio, but the walkthrough had people go through the site. The user testing was helpful too, because even though I got some answers that weere not helpful, I still did get some feedback that was helpful, and the few anwers I got was worth all the not so helpful ones I got. Going through the user testing allowed me to pretty much reaffirm what I had found in the user research process and allowed me to rethink my research and see what shortcomings I had while designing, what misunderstandings my site was giving off, and how to continue making my portfolio site better.
        </p>
         <h1 class="page-title">Incorporation of Findings</h1>
        <p>
          The user research gave me a good idea of how I should go about creating my personal portfolio. For example, during the user interviews, interviewees kept talking about having the site simple but organized so I remembered that the most. Though I remember some talked about keeping things professional, I knew that I would be at a disadvantage being professional due to my lack of project work so I went for a more friendly route in terms of my site. Looking at the competitive analysis I thought that my idea would at least make my site stand out relative to tohers, which is worth something. After the user testing phase, some of my users liked my more friendly approach(or didn't want to hurt my feelings), and keeping things simple let the click/question tests and walkthrough be mostly successful. 
        </p>

        <p>
          However, I realized a lot of my shortcomings in my design in that maybe my site looks a bit too simple in terms of layout and could be changed. Users had commented that they liked my color scheme, but because of my color choices I couldn't use white space as effectively as others did, and I am still on the fence on how the pros of having a good color scheme could outweight the cons of having access to whitespace and how it can create a more clean/less busy look on the interface. I also was missing some common website functionality, such as having my main name in the top left corner being a way to go back to the home page. The walkthrough/user click tests showed me this is what is expected of other sites(such as Youtube and Facebook) and I had skipped over this functionality by accident, thinking that the Home tab I had created was all I needed to get back to the main page. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The walkthrough also let me know that even though I was aiming for a friendly site, that my entire site could be improved; I was only trying to make the home page the more friendly page and the rest more professional, but the feedback I got made me think I should just double down on having a more personable site all around. This could be done by having more pictures and perhaps more information about myself, both of which I have incoporated while revising my site. There is more I know I need/should add to my site, and I am slowly working on incorporating all my findings that I get not just through the research and testing we have to do in class, but as I learn from experience as I go into the working world.
